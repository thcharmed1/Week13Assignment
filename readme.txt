I really enjoyed the book that we had assigned this semester. My favorite part was seeing all the do's and dont's for website design. I thought the author of the book has a good sense of humour about some of the bas designs. I enjoyed seeing how websites improved thier sites and then reading about how those changes helped with things like engagement or customer retention.
